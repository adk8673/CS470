CS4760 Project 1

In this project, a process, proc_fan, is kicked off using the command line (with standard input usually streamed into the process from a file, testing.data)
The input from stdin is the target process, with its command line arguments.  In this project, it is usually the other program created, testsim, which will
is called from the command line with its arguments.  It iterates a number of times based on a command line arguement, each time sleeping by the other command 
line value.

The project is hosted on github at github.com/adk8673/CS470
